This repository will be kept up to date with all my progress on learning Laravel from the ground up.

## Makefile
### Update all submodules
In order to run this command, make sure to set the `SSH_KEY_PATH` environment variable to the right path:
```
export SSH_KEY_PATH=<PATH>    
```
After that, you can update all submodules to their most recent commit on the main branch of the repository:
```
make update
```
